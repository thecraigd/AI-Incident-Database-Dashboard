The changes to the system allowed Centrelink’s internal programs to autonomously send information requests to citizens if their requests did not match with government records. This caused a dramatic increase in these requests, which brought widespread complaint, especially because a significant portion of the alleged discrepancies could be validly explained by the recipient.
