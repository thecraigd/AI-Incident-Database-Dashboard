    "description": "In 2019, facial recognition technology misidentified Francisco Arteaga as a suspect in an armed robbery in New Jersey. The incident led to nearly four years of pretrial incarceration. Despite having an alibi, Arteaga was charged based on the flawed identification. The legal battle that followed resulted in a court ruling requiring police to reveal details about the algorithms used in facial recognition. The process exposed significant gaps in transparency and accountability.",

    "description": "A phishing campaign has reportedly been impersonating Meta support using a fake chatbot interface to hijack Instagram Business accounts. Victims received emails claiming ad violations and were directed to a fraudulent site mimicking Meta's support. There, a simulated chatbot instructed users to add the attacker’s Authenticator app as a secure login method, enabling account takeover. It remains unclear whether the chatbot used AI or was human-operated via a bot-like interface. See editor's note.",

    "description": "A WIRED investigation found that OpenAI’s video generation model, Sora, exhibits representational bias across race, gender, body type, and disability. In tests using 250 prompts, Sora was more likely to depict CEOs and professors as men, flight attendants and childcare workers as women, and showed limited or stereotypical portrayals of disabled individuals and people with larger bodies.",
